          <ul>
            <li>
              Overall, revenue from female customers tends to be higher than
              male customers in most months. This trend is particularly strong
              from September 2023 through January 2024.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-2">
              <strong>Action:</strong> Continue to prioritize and expand
              marketing campaigns targeting female customers, especially during
              months where their spending is significantly higher (e.g.,
              November 2023 to January 2024). Consider launching new products or
              promotions that appeal specifically to this segment.

            2. Address the Decline in Female Revenue in Recent Months
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There is a noticeable decline in revenue from female customers in
              August 2024, dropping to $139,340.75, which is significantly lower
              compared to previous months.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-2">
              <strong>Action:</strong> Investigate potential causes for this
              drop, such as changes in product offerings, seasonality, or
              customer preferences. Re-engage this segment with targeted
              promotions, loyalty programs, or feedback surveys to understand
              their current needs and preferences.

          </h2>

            <li>
              Male revenue shows peaks in March 2024 and January 2024, with
              March being the highest at $353,117.77.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-2">
              <strong>Action:</strong> Focus on understanding what drove higher
              male spending during these peak months. Replicate successful
              strategies during these months, such as seasonal promotions or
              product launches, and consider rolling out similar campaigns in
              other months to sustain or boost revenue from male customers.

              Male revenue saw significant declines in August 2024, dropping to
              $76,398.00, which is notably lower compared to earlier months.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-2">
              <strong>Action:</strong> Develop specific campaigns to boost male
              customer engagement during low-revenue months. Consider offering
              exclusive discounts, bundling products, or running time-limited
              offers that target male customersâ€™ interests.

              While there are months where one gender segment significantly
              outperforms the other, overall revenue balance between genders is
              crucial for sustainable growth.

              both male and female customers. Tailor messaging, product
              recommendations, and promotions to resonate with each segment.

              The revenue trends indicate different spending behaviors between
